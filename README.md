## Test Rules

The purpose of this exercise is get an understanding of your approach to some common frontend development tasks that will be encountered throughout your career. While there is no right or wrong way to complete the designs, we’re looking for an understanding of best frontend practices in your approach. The goal is to have a functional and accurate representation of the designs provided. Details on modules are outlined below.

  

## General

- Build can be done using React if preferred. Feel free to use create-react-app to kickstart the process if you decide to move forward with React. A static build is welcome!

- Must be built to align with a 12 column grid system.

- Timing on transitions should be kept to a 0.6s time.

  

## Navigation

- Must be sticky.

- Upon scroll apply a #e2d8ce colored background to the Navigation with a .8 opacity.

- Navigation should move up and off screen while scrolling down past the Hero element, reappear on scroll up.

- Please have links drive user to a new page. This can feature the same content provided with updated Lorem Ipsum copy.

  

## Hero

- Fullwidth background image that changes between desktop and mobile breakpoints. (767px should start the mobile break)

- Radio button selection changes the images that are applied to the background of the hero.

- Add to bag CTA must increase the bag number count in the navigation.

- Down arrow acts as a jump link to the next section of the page. Please apply easing on the scroll.

  

## Content Section

- All images should have intrinsic lazy loading. Container should be `#eaeaea` background color before image asset is loaded in.

- Image carousel should be built to expect variable height with images.

- Image carousel should operable on swipe / drag and slide number click.

- Right aligned image should stay static.

  

## Video Player (This is a nice to have, feel free to bypass this section during the build)

- Any video or solution can be used here.

- Video player to fit fullscreen. Fullscreen proportions must be kept on window resize.

- On play video image still to fade out. Fades back in on pause.

- Scrolling video offscreen should pause video and reapply still image.

  

Upon completion please give a brief outline of the reasoning behind your decisions made during the build. The goal here is just to see what your process is and you’d approach designs given to you.
